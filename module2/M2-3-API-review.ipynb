    "## Review Application Programing Interfaces (APIs) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format\n",
    "Understanding how APIs work is crucial for those learning about AI, as APIs provide the standardized mechanisms for accessing and integrating AI models and services into applications. Being able to effectively interact with APIs enables learners to explore different AI offerings, leverage AI frameworks and libraries, and incorporate AI capabilities into a wide range of projects, which is an increasingly valuable skill as AI becomes more pervasive across various domains.<P>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, familiarity with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is essential for students learning about AI, as this lightweight data format is widely used for request/response payloads in AI APIs, configuration files in AI frameworks, and the representation of input/output data for AI models. Understanding the structure and syntax of JSON allows students to seamlessly interact with AI-related tools and services, parse and manipulate the data used in AI applications, and facilitate the integration of AI components into larger, distributed systems - all of which are crucial skills for AI practitioners working in real-world, web-based environments.<P>\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, here are are using a REST API. The use of RESTful (Representational State Transfer) APIs is highly relevant for students learning about AI, as REST has become the de facto standard for modern web services and APIs, including those used in AI-powered applications. REST APIs follow standardized principles and conventions, such as the use of HTTP methods for CRUD operations on resources, a resource-oriented design that aligns well with data-centric AI tasks, and the use of flexible data formats like JSON - all of which enable AI practitioners to easily integrate AI capabilities into their applications by leveraging a vast ecosystem of data sources, services, and tools through well-documented, stateless, and scalable API interfaces.\n",
