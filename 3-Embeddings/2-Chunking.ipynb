If something seems off, don’t hesitate to contact the vet. The owner should provide both a primary vet’s contact information and a backup emergency vet that is open 24/7.

Use the provided test strips — just dip one in the water for 2 seconds and compare it to the color chart on the bottle. The key things to look for are sanitizer level, pH, and alkalinity. Ideal chlorine levels should be between 1 and 3 ppm (bromine: 3–5 ppm), pH should be in the 7.2 to 7.8 range, and total alkalinity between 80 and 120 ppm. If sanitizer levels are low, add a small amount of chlorine granules (usually 1–2 teaspoons). If pH is low, use pH increaser; if it’s high, add pH decreaser — both are clearly labeled. Stir the water with a clean cup or just run the jets for a few minutes to circulate any added chemicals.
